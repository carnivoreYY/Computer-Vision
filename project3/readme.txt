In this project:
I choose small batch_size = 25 with high tiers = 4000 such that I can fit the model better. On the other side, I will choose drop_out rate = 0.4 to avoid overfitting.
Also, when it comes to CNN layers, I choose padding = "same". For pooling layers, I choose pool3x3 and pool4X4 with strides=2.
